# Mini-Project---Smart-Hydroponics-System
An automated NFT hydroponic system is designed to grow leafy greens indoors. It uses 90% less water, promotes faster growth rates, and provides higher yields in controlled environments. The system includes a 1:30 sloped channel design, UV lighting, and monitors temperature and water levels with Arduino, DS18B20, and HC-SR04 sensors.
